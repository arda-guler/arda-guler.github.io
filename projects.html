	<h3 id="simulators">Simulators</h3>
	<p>Simulations are only as good as our understanding of the universe is. They are often even worse due to the limitations
	of the tools we use to simulate (now computers, quantum computers and supercomputers). However, most of the time, they are more than good enough and
	they allow us to analyze systems in fast, cheap and flexible ways.</p>

			<p>OrbitSim3D is an orbital/celestial mechanics and space mission simulator. It uses n-body physics, which is a more realistic representation
			of the real universe than the Keplerian 2-body systems are. It can also account for the perturbations from the non-spherical gravity sources.
			Using OS3D you can simulate moon systems, planetary systems, star systems, lagrange points, asteroid passes, deep space maneuvers, geostationary
			satellites, Hohmann transfers and many other things you can imagine. It is highly customizable and you can create just about any system you like,
			as long as relativistic effects can be ignored. It can calculate orbital parameters, plot variables over time, or display variables in real-time.
			It is also quite simple and only uses a few thousand lines of code. There is no 3rd party physics engine involved, and rendering is done in an 
			extremely simple way via OpenGL.<br><br>OrbitSim3D is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D/blob/master/LICENSE">

			<button class="greenButton" onclick='window.location.href = "https://github.com/arda-guler/Supercluster3D"'>Supercluster3D</button>
			<p>Supercluster3D is a cosmic scale n-body simulation that is also meant to account for various equations modeling the expansion of the 
			universe. It can randomly generate and simulate hundreds (or many thousands, if someone has lots of time and/or a good computer) of 
			galaxies in volumes of space that are usually measured using Megaparsecs.<br><br>
			Supercluster3D was originally created as a response to the floating point precision errors I was facing in OrbitSim3D with extremely large 
			and small numbers. I built the n-body simulation from ground up, but this time, I gave up on the SI units such as meters or seconds and tried 
			to keep all numbers close to 1, by using units like Megaparsecs (and more arbitrary ones like 1E40 kilograms) in my computations. Originally 
			I wanted to code Supercluster3D in Python just like OS3D, but simulating the interactions between hundreds of galaxies turned out to be extraordinarily 
			slow. I thought that I finally hit the limit where I'd have to switch to a compiled language (and a fast one at that), and rewrote the program 
			in C++. Using the GLFW library, I also implemented a basic 3D visualization.

			<p>TrajectorySim is a sounding rocket simulator. I programmed it specifically for the student rocketry society I am a part of - METU Rocket Society. 
			Basic equations governing the flight of a rocket are actually pretty simple, but what is so impressive about this simulator is that it can do complex 
			drag calculations. It is incredibly hard to get drag equations right without real data, and this is about as good as you can get without CFD or wind

			<p>Mechuilibria is a 2D particle mass simulator. It can be used to evaluate simple static or dynamic systems. You can create

			I started working on Mechuilibria as a double pendulum calculator (after seeing some interesting videos on YouTube), but as
			I finished programming the pendulum script, I saw that this simple physics engine had a much bigger potential. Now, you can
			not only create pendulums, but also cars, cranes, struts, trusses or whatever other 2D systems you can come up with.<br><br>

			Exoplanet Survey Satellite). I've written this tool for my own use while I was examining the "Planet Hunters" citizen-science
			project on zooniverse.org. It aids the eye by doing data binning and representing the general shape of the light curves

			<p>Injector Calc is a flow calculator tool for the initial portion of a symmetrical impinging injector setup under various

			library I've been using had major changes since its beta version and it now relies on an earlier version of the said library.)
			<br><br>The calculations of the rest of the flow sequence is partly chaotic and requires CFD (or a flow test) - this is just a 
			helper tool to give a quick idea to the user.</p>

			<p>pyTuneGen is an automated music generator written in Python. (It can export them as MIDIs too!)
			It can optionally be customized by picking scales, time signatures, bpms; or with some rather unorthodox variables 
			(e.g. to control what ratio of bars you want to be repeated). <br><br>You may use this as a tool to get inspired -I sometimes do that myself-, 
			or you can pick the good portions of a particular tune to use in your music. (No, I won't sue you.) That being said, there is no artificial 
			intelligence involved; so if you are a music creator, it might also be a good tool to clean up your plagiarist subconscious. 
			<br><br>If you've been doing that for long enough, you know what I'm talking about.<br><br>
			<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytunegen/">pyTuneGen is available on PyPI</a> and can easily be installed by the command 'pip install pytunegen'.

			<p>This repository contains a bunch of simple image processing tools, which I use to give certain effects or apply filters to, well, images!<br>
			There are tools that can apply various types of contrast, which I usually use to give images a retro 8-color display effect. This collection 
			of tools could actually be merged into a single program with various modes, but I think just double-clicking on what you want makes everything 
			faster. Disagree? It is open source, and the MIT License is pretty relaxed, take the scripts and do whatever you want!

			However, there are distinct differences. I'm using OpenGL wireframe graphics for rendering, the rotation is already locked into docking
			orientation, and there is an autopilot! Also mine has sound too, it beeps and wails alarms when necessary. You can also hear the nice
			puffing sounds of the RCS thrusters.<br><br>
			Ah, and since I thought it was too easy as is, you get no numbers on the HUD. Just shapes and guidelines.<br><br>
			Also the RCS thrusters sometimes do defective maneuvers. Haha :D
