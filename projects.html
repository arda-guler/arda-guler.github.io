	<h3 id="simulators">Simulators</h3>
	<p>Simulations are only as good as our understanding of the universe is. They are often even worse due to the limitations
	of the tools we use to simulate (now computers, quantum computers and supercomputers). However, most of the time, they are more than good enough and
	they allow us to analyze systems in fast, cheap and flexible ways.</p>

			<p>OrbitSim3D is an orbital/celestial mechanics and space mission simulator. It uses n-body physics, which is a more realistic representation
			of the real universe than the Keplerian 2-body systems are. It can also account for the perturbations from the non-spherical gravity sources.
			Using OS3D you can simulate moon systems, planetary systems, star systems, lagrange points, asteroid passes, deep space maneuvers, geostationary
			satellites, Hohmann transfers and many other things you can imagine. It is highly customizable and you can create just about any system you like,
			as long as relativistic effects can be ignored. It can calculate orbital parameters, plot variables over time, or display variables in real-time.
			It is also quite simple and only uses a few thousand lines of code. There is no 3rd party physics engine involved, and rendering is done in an 
			extremely simple way via OpenGL.<br><br>OrbitSim3D is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/arda-guler/orbitSim3D/blob/master/LICENSE">

			<p>TrajectorySim is a sounding rocket simulator. I programmed it specifically for the student rocketry society I am a part of - METU Rocket Society. 
			Basic equations governing the flight of a rocket are actually pretty simple, but what is so impressive about this simulator is that it can do complex 
			drag calculations. It is incredibly hard to get drag equations right without real data, and this is about as good as you can get without CFD or wind 
			tunnel tests.<br><br>All Rights Reserved. (Although it is open source, you may NOT copy or use the software without my explicit permission.)</p>

			<p>Mechuilibria is a 2D particle mass simulator. It can be used to evaluate simple static or dynamic systems. You can create
			links with various stiffness values, apply forces, calculate the center of mass of systems and observe their movements.<br><br>
			I started working on Mechuilibria as a double pendulum calculator (after seeing some interesting videos on YouTube), but as
			I finished programming the pendulum script, I saw that this simple physics engine had a much bigger potential. Now, you can
			not only create pendulums, but also cars, cranes, struts, trusses or whatever other 2D systems you can come up with.<br><br>

	<h3>Science and Engineering Tools</h3>
	<p id="science-engineering">Apart from simulators, there are some simpler, often specialized calculation or helper tools that I've written.</p>

			<button class="greenButton" onclick='window.location.href = "https://github.com/arda-guler/varieye"'>Varieye</button>
			<p>Varieye is basically a FITS file reader for data from NASA space telescopes such as Kepler or TESS (Transiting 
			Exoplanet Survey Satellite). I've written this tool for my own use while I was examining the "Planet Hunters" citizen-science
			project on zooniverse.org. It aids the eye by doing data binning and representing the general shape of the light curves
			with a red line.<br><br>

			<p>RMS Arm visualizes the kinematics of a 3 segment robotic arm with shoulder, elbow and wrist joints with limited
			angle movement. Although it is not a true recreation, it was inspired by the Canadarm aboard ISS and the earlier ones
			that flew on the US Space Shuttle. It uses OpenGL for 3D rendering.<br><br>

			<p>Injector Calc is a flow calculator tool for the initial portion of a symmetrical impinging injector setup under various
			acceleration levels.<br><br>As much as it is a useful calculator, it was also a nice practice for GUI design. (However the GUI
			library I've been using had major changes since its beta version and it now relies on an earlier version of the said library.)
			<br><br>The calculations of the rest of the flow sequence is partly chaotic and requires CFD (or a flow test) - this is just a 
			helper tool to give a quick idea to the user.</p>

	<h3>Music and Art Software</h3>
	<p id="music-art">I also program stuff that can help you get inspired.</p>

			<button class="greenButton" onclick='window.location.href = "https://github.com/arda-guler/pyTuneGen"'>pyTuneGen</button>
			<p>pyTuneGen is an automated music generator written in Python. (It can export them as MIDIs too!)
			It can optionally be customized by picking scales, time signatures, bpms; or with some rather unorthodox variables 
			(e.g. to control what ratio of bars you want to be repeated). <br><br>You may use this as a tool to get inspired -I sometimes do that myself-, 
			or you can pick the good portions of a particular tune to use in your music. (No, I won't sue you.) That being said, there is no artificial 
			intelligence involved; so if you are a music creator, it might also be a good tool to clean up your plagiarist subconscious. 
			<br><br>If you've been doing that for long enough, you know what I'm talking about.<br><br>
			<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytunegen/">pyTuneGen is available on PyPI</a> and can easily be installed by the command 'pip install pytunegen'.

			<p>ASCII Randfield is a random ASCII art generator. It combines shapes such as lines, rectangles, discs etc. and generates an ASCII
			image. You may let it run with no parameters or configure it according to your liking. It's mainly meant to be an inspiration tool to
			create landscapes, cityscapes, abstract art or whatever you can make of it. Its "stream" feature can also be used to generate glitchy
			graphic effects.<br><br>
			ASCII Randfield repository also includes seven_lines.py, which is a "command line screensaver".

			<button class="greenButton" onclick='window.location.href = "https://github.com/arda-guler/miniDocking3D"'>miniDocking3D</button>
			<p>miniDocking3D is a space station docking simulation game inspired by <a href="https://iss-sim.spacex.com/">SpaceX ISS Docking Simulator.</a>
			However, there are distinct differences. I'm using OpenGL wireframe graphics for rendering, the rotation is already locked into docking
			orientation, and there is an autopilot! Also mine has sound too, it beeps and wails alarms when necessary. You can also hear the nice
			puffing sounds of the RCS thrusters.<br><br>
			Ah, and since I thought it was too easy as is, you get no numbers on the HUD. Just shapes and guidelines.<br><br>
			Also the RCS thrusters sometimes do defective maneuvers. Haha :D

			<p>miniLanding3D is a lunar landing simulation game. You take manual control (with optional autothrottle autopilot) of a lunar lander 
			at the final phase of the landing, and you have to cancel your velocity and make a soft touchdown before you run out of propellant.<br><br>
			ML3D was partially inspired by <a href="http://eaglelander3d.com/">Eagle Lander 3D</a>, a more complex simulator which simulates the 
			historic Apollo lunar landings. My graphics might not compare, but hey - the physics and the control mechanisms are the same! (Also the code is shorter.)

			<p>HaritaWars is a mini strategy game based on a similar game I used to play in high school with my friends. The digital version
			gives the control of countries to AI players (either with predefined actions or machine learning algorithms) and allows the user
			to watch the events unfold as AIs do their decisions. The game runs until there is one country remaining - it might take 30 turns,
			or it might take 3000.<br><br>
			HaritaWars also comes with a map creation tool and instructions on how to interface your AI algorithm with the game.
